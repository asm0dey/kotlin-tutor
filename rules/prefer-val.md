# Prefer val

## Default to Immutable

- Properties and locals default to `val` — declare `var` only when mutation is required and the mutation is intentional
- `var` in a data class signals you're modelling mutable state by accident; convert to `val` and reconstruct via `copy()` instead
- The reviewer test: "would I be surprised if this changed?" — if yes, it's a `val`

## When `var` Is Actually Right

- Accumulators inside a function body where the alternative would obscure intent
- State machines whose entire purpose is to advance
- Backing fields for computed properties that must memoize across calls

## Reconstruction Over Mutation

- Update a value type via `someValue.copy(field = newValue)`, not `someValue.field = newValue`
- This composes cleanly with `?.let { … }` and stream-style transformations
- Mutating a shared instance through a property setter is the bug factory `val` exists to prevent
